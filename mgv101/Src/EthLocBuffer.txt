@ingroup EthLocBuffer

@section Introduction Introduction
The MGV101 EthernetLoconetBuffer is a device acting as a gateway between Loconet and the network connection 
of a PC. This eliminates the use of a serial usb converter, which sometimes gives troubles.<br> 
Now just connect the MGV101 to your PC or router, setup RocRail for MGV101 and have fun!<br>

@section Connection 
Some network interfaces have an autodetection regarding the connection. If the MGV101 <br>
is not reqognized, use a cross cable or a router / switch.<br>
On Windows, youm must disable the wireless interface!

@section Software Overview. 
Routine \ref EthLocBufferMain checks if any data is present in the ethernet interface or LocoNet.<br>
Depending on the data type, ethernet data is or Loconet data is forwarded to the Loconet or Ethernet bus.<br> 
If you want to examine the software, start in \ref main. The software itself is not complicated and well documented to my opinion.
 
@section External Software Modules. 
For Loconet the Loconet driver is used from http://sourceforge.net/projects/embeddedloconet/  <br>
- The MGV101 is added as option to the driver. <br>
- Non used function are removed. 

The used Ethernet software is from http://www.ulrichradig.de/home/index.php/avr/eth_m32_ex <br> 
- The driver is slightly modified for transmitting unicast messages. 
- Retransmit flag is added.
- Added en- or disable of retransmit when transmitted packets does not receive an ACK. 

@section Building the code. 
- Download WINAVR version 20070122 at http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/20070122/ <br>
  Other versions may also be used, but tested is with the 20070122 version. 
- Open the Programmers NotePad project file MGV101.pnproj. Programmers NotePad is an installation option of WinAvr. 
- Select Tools->Make All
- Flash the generated hex file EtLocBuf.hex into the Atmel microcontroller.
