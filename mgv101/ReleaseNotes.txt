Version 1.7
 * Padding enabled of ENC28J60. By this network messages with a size lower 64 are filled up to 64.
 * Non used items (for example UDP) removed from stack.c 
 * ENC driver cleaned up.
 * If connection was ended by RocRail MGV101 did not see this, fixed this. After connection is ended 
   the run led and the TCPIP led will blink simultaniously.   

Version 1.6 16-10-2010
 * Jumpers can be used to select a FIXED IP address for the MGV101. 
    * No jumpers set is 192.168.0.200
    * Jumper on PC0 (JP1) is 192.168.1.200
    * Jumper on PC1 (JP2) is 192.168.100.88
    * All other combinations default to 192.168.0.200
 * If no valid IP data is received / connection not present the ethernet led (LED 5) will blink to indicate no connection.
   With connection the connection to RocRail is ment, not if MGV101 is connected to the nework. If connection is 
   present can be observed on the leds of the macjack.  
 * Added a fix, after certain message types the target mac address was incorrect. 
    
Version 1.5 14-10-2010
 * IP address set fixed to 192.168.100.88. 

Version 1.4 13-10-2010
 * UDP is replaced by TCP/IP. 
 * Used TCPIP stack is now from http://www.ulrichradig.de/home/index.php/avr/eth_m32_ex  
 * Generated hex file renamed to MGV101.hex 

Version 1.3 04-08-2010
 * ENC handling updated. The status register is examined after a message is transmitted. If transmit
   fails, it's retried to transmit the message. 
 * Sometimes messages transmitted on the ethernet bus get lost (although ENC handling was updated). 
   The ENC28J60 tells us the message was transmitted succesfully, but WireShark and RocRail received nothing. 
   This causes troubles with sensor messages. As temp work around added transmitting sensor messages twice.
 * UserIo IP routines removed / simplified. 
  
Version 1.2 21-07-2010
 * Removed ALL serial logging and serial output for user.  
 * The loconet receive buffer is increased to 600 bytes. Buffer variables for buffer changed to 16 bits for this.  
 * Non used functions removed. 
 * Added extra loop for transmitting loconet data. 

Version 1.1 13-07-2010
 * Added extra logging option using jumper 2. Loconet data and UDP data are forwarded on the serial port. 
 * The echo in the Loconet driver is removed. 

Version 1.0 28-06-2010
 * Initial version.
